# Taskade MCP Server — Integration Examples

Ready-to-use templates for connecting Taskade MCP Server to popular AI and automation platforms.

## PopUpEmpire.wtf Foundation

Use [`popupempire-taskade-foundation.md`](./popupempire-taskade-foundation.md) to set up the four core verticals (Shop_wtf, Blog_wtf, Hack_wtf, Club_wtf) with Manus as the execution workhorse and Claude as planning/review support.

## n8n

Import [`n8n-taskade-mcp-workflow.json`](./n8n-taskade-mcp-workflow.json) into n8n to create an AI agent with access to all 57 Taskade tools.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [n8n MCP Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-mcp) community node
2. Set `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true` in your n8n environment
3. Get your Taskade API key from [Settings > API](https://taskade.com)

### Setup

1. In n8n, go to **Settings > Community Nodes > Install** and add `n8n-nodes-mcp`
2. Import the workflow JSON via **Workflow > Import from File**
3. Replace `YOUR_TASKADE_API_KEY` in the Taskade MCP node with your actual API key
4. Configure your OpenAI (or other LLM) credentials
5. Activate the workflow

### What you can do

Ask the AI agent natural language questions like:

- "Show me all my projects in Taskade"
- "Create a new project called Q1 Planning with tasks for each team"
- "What tasks are overdue?"
- "Create an AI agent that monitors project deadlines"

> **Note:** The published `@taskade/mcp-server` CLI runs over **stdio** only — configure the n8n MCP Client node with the command `npx -y @taskade/mcp-server` and a `TASKADE_API_KEY` environment variable. The `--http`/`--token` flags are **not** supported by the published CLI. A standalone HTTP/SSE transport is not yet exposed; track the hosted remote endpoint at [#6](https://github.com/taskade/mcp/issues/6).
